### Git MCP Usage Policy (Read‑only by default)

- **Default behavior**: Use Git only for read-only operations. Prefer Git MCP; CLI is allowed when necessary.
  - Allowed by default: `status`, `diff` (unstaged/staged), `log`, `show`, branch/commit comparisons.
  - When using CLI, ensure non-interactive usage and append `| cat` to paged outputs.

- **No mutating Git operations unless explicitly requested by the user**:
  - Do not run: `add`, `commit`, `restore`, `reset`, `rm`, `mv`, `merge`, `rebase`, `cherry-pick`, `stash`, `tag`, `push`, `pull`, `fetch --prune`, `switch`/`checkout` that changes branches, or any force operations.

- **When the user explicitly asks for a mutating operation**:
  - Proceed without additional confirmation; prefer Git MCP for the action and fall back to CLI only if needed.
  - Use clear commit messages and avoid pushing unless the user explicitly requests it.

- **After making code edits**: It’s OK to show read-only diffs/status to summarize changes. Do not auto-stage, commit, or create branches unless asked.

- **Branch policy**:
  - Do not create or rename branches for generated changes.
  - Operate only on branches created by the user.
  - Do not switch branches unless explicitly requested.
