# WIP Project Policy

This repository is actively evolving.

- Assistants should prefer progress over strict backward compatibility.
- It is acceptable to propose or implement new features.
- Breaking changes to the public API are allowed when they simplify the design, improve DX/UX, or enable better performance.

Operational guidance:

- When introducing a breaking change, update affected code (demos, tests, docs) in the same change and include migration notes in the summary.
- Call out breaking changes explicitly in PR titles and commit messages.
- Favor clear, incremental edits; proceed without waiting for approval if you can safely complete the change.
