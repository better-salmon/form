# al-formo

Experimental zero-deps form hook library for React 19, inspired by [TanStack Form](https://tanstack.com/form/latest).

- Very strong typing
- Sync and async validation (debounced, cancelable)
- Cross-field triggers and submission/touched metadata
- Standard Schema compatible
- Minimal API: `useForm`, `useField`
